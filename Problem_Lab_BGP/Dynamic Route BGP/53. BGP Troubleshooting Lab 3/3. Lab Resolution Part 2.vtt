00:00.820 --> 00:02.640
What we see is not wrong.

00:02.650 --> 00:08.510
A neighbor has been configured the site looks good.

00:08.620 --> 00:11.990
There is our BGP configuration.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.880
The site looks wrong.

00:14.480 --> 00:27.440
So confetti Rodda DGP sixty five thousand two new neighbor to donate to today to donate to remoted on

00:27.440 --> 00:29.620
the system sixty five thousand one.

00:29.930 --> 00:39.050
We want to change this to be neighbor to donate to donate to dot 1 and notice as soon as we do that

00:39.200 --> 00:50.030
the neighbor relationship has come up on both sides say BGP neighbor is up Chiv IP BGP neighbors on

00:50.030 --> 00:51.490
Route 1.

00:51.740 --> 01:01.100
We see that the neighbor relationship is established that looks good on the side show IP BGP neighbors

01:01.100 --> 01:12.520
rather neighbor 15 1 1 2 which is what history is established going down through the output 8 2 8 2

01:12.680 --> 01:17.420
8 1 is established that looks a lot better.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.210
Should IP BGP.

01:20.210 --> 01:29.990
We see the loop back of route one advertised so we can ping the loop back of Route 1 and on Route 1

01:30.050 --> 01:32.000
show IP BGP.

01:32.030 --> 01:35.920
We've now learnt routes from rodder to.

01:36.440 --> 01:42.750
So as an example we can paying the loopback of Route 2 as follows.

01:42.830 --> 01:47.190
Can we paying the loopback of road 3.

01:47.480 --> 01:48.900
Yes we can.

01:49.010 --> 01:56.990
So that looks good but can we paying the loop back of a fall at the moment.

01:56.990 --> 01:57.860
We can't

02:00.740 --> 02:10.800
notice network 4 doesn't appear in the BGP writing table so show IP BGP and show IP route shows us that

02:11.130 --> 02:22.890
network 4 is not in either the BGP or IP writing table but we can ping router 3 so we can get to this

02:22.890 --> 02:30.520
interface and we can get to the loopback of rotisserie but we can't get to the loopback or brought a

02:30.520 --> 02:30.960
full.
