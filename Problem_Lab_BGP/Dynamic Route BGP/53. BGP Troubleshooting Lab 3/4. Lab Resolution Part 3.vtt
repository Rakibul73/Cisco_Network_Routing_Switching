WEBVTT

00:00.250 --> 00:14.590
So in rotisserie show IP BGP network 4 doesn't show in the BJP writing table show IP BGP neighbor the

00:14.680 --> 00:19.070
neighbor relationship 1 1 2 is established.

00:19.300 --> 00:26.990
So we have a neighbor relationship to Rodda to scrolling down the neighbor relationship to 17:1 one

00:27.010 --> 00:31.660
too which is rockfall is currently active.

00:31.660 --> 00:33.000
That's not good.

00:34.650 --> 00:41.110
Show run BGP configuration looks good.

00:41.520 --> 00:52.230
We've got a neighbor relationship configured and brought a full show run.

00:52.270 --> 00:58.420
We've got this neighbor relationship configured so show IP BGP naver

01:01.140 --> 01:08.360
we've got the same problem on a waterfall neighbor relationship he's active rather than established.

01:08.370 --> 01:16.140
So again looking at that configuration BGP looks good.

01:16.140 --> 01:20.780
So is there another problem lower in the assigned model.

01:20.970 --> 01:27.990
The routing looks good but can wrote a full ping router three.

01:28.070 --> 01:29.960
It doesn't look like it can.

01:30.170 --> 01:34.670
Can't ping the IP address.

01:34.780 --> 01:38.850
Ken wrote a sweeping reform.

01:39.310 --> 01:41.260
It's not able to do that.

01:41.710 --> 01:44.480
All the interfaces up.

01:44.570 --> 01:46.250
So show IP interface brief

01:48.790 --> 01:52.710
interfaces up a line protocol is up.

01:52.750 --> 01:55.580
What about on the side show IP interface.

01:55.600 --> 02:07.000
Brief interfaces up line protocol is up but can you see the problem.

02:07.180 --> 02:10.020
What's the problem in this network.

02:11.690 --> 02:19.400
So these two routers are connected via gigabit 00 on brought a full This is the IP address on gigabit

02:19.470 --> 02:26.030
00 on router 3 however gigabit or 00 has the same IP address.

02:26.090 --> 02:28.540
It's the wrong IP address.

02:28.820 --> 02:35.070
So show run this IP address is incorrect.

02:35.570 --> 02:48.160
So interface gigabit 0 0 IP address 17 1 1 1 subnet mask of 24 can rotisserie now ping wrote a full

02:49.860 --> 02:54.510
Yes it can show IP BGP neighbor

02:58.690 --> 03:08.020
neighbor relationship to 15 is still established neighbor relationship to 17 1 1 2 is set to 2 active

03:08.960 --> 03:12.670
BGP may take a while to bring up the neighbor relationship.

03:12.980 --> 03:19.850
And there you go it's just gone up on both sides so we can see the neighbor relationship is now up on

03:19.850 --> 03:22.520
the side of i.p BGP neighbors.

03:25.580 --> 03:30.470
Notice the neighbor relationship to rodder 3 is now established.

03:30.740 --> 03:32.370
So that looks a lot better.

03:33.560 --> 03:39.200
So unright a one show IP BGP we haven't learnt about network 4 yet.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.170
That may take a while.

03:43.080 --> 03:47.960
Let's check if a network for was advertised at or three.

03:48.030 --> 03:53.600
So show IP BGP we are now learning about network 4.

03:53.910 --> 03:57.220
So can we ping network for yes we can.

03:57.510 --> 03:59.160
What about on rodded to

04:02.470 --> 04:08.340
we all seeing a problem here between Route One and router to.

04:08.690 --> 04:10.130
So we need to investigate that.

04:10.120 --> 04:16.450
So shop IP BGP summary that looks OK but are we learning about network fall.

04:16.670 --> 04:23.830
Yes we are serrata to paying the Lubeck of a waterfall show IP BGP neighbors.

04:23.960 --> 04:27.880
Let's see if there's a problem between one and two.

04:28.550 --> 04:35.810
We told here that the state is idle.

04:35.940 --> 04:42.930
So let's see what the problem is looks like it's now come up again without me doing anything.

04:42.930 --> 04:46.390
So this may be a package Tracy issue.

04:47.420 --> 04:47.760
Sure.

04:47.770 --> 04:51.880
And PBG P The rot has now been learnt.

04:52.060 --> 04:56.170
So can we paying for that for that forward for.

04:56.230 --> 05:05.170
Yes we can show IP wrote shows us that route in the IP writing table show IP BGP shows us that route

05:05.520 --> 05:07.480
in the BJP writing table.

05:07.570 --> 05:16.120
It originated in a tunnel system number 65000 for went to 65000 three then to 65000 to was advertised

05:16.120 --> 05:19.320
by this rodded to the local Rodda.

05:19.450 --> 05:25.660
So we've now got that wrote in the local routing table.

05:25.990 --> 05:31.100
So it looks like it just took a trace a bit of time to sort itself out.

05:31.960 --> 05:35.790
And it looks like things are now working as they should.

05:35.910 --> 05:36.240
Right.

05:36.250 --> 05:39.640
One can paying the loopback of wrote a full

05:42.290 --> 05:46.660
now c'mon to remember for the real world is show TZP brief.

05:46.790 --> 05:47.720
This will show you.

05:47.720 --> 05:58.910
Connections between BGP routers BGP users TCAP so we can see that router too has initiated a TCAP session

05:58.910 --> 06:04.820
to the local router BGP uses TZP port 179.

06:04.820 --> 06:07.760
This is a ephemeral or random port number.

06:08.090 --> 06:19.390
So rodded to initiated the session to the local writer wrote a one show TZP brief on Route 3.

06:19.700 --> 06:32.340
We can see that 15 1 1 2 router 3 initiated a session to Rohtak to and it initiated a session to a for

06:33.170 --> 06:38.510
established means that the TZP sessions have been established.

06:38.540 --> 06:45.950
If you don't see DCP sessions established between your routers you've probably got a problem with either

06:46.340 --> 06:49.120
late to late free will leave for

06:52.180 --> 06:58.900
as an example on rodder 3 or shut the interface down show TZP brief.

06:59.120 --> 07:07.930
Notice we no longer have a TZP session between 17 1 1 1 and 17 1 1 2.

07:08.070 --> 07:16.590
If I know shutter that interface interfaces come up what we should see is that a relationship is established

07:16.590 --> 07:20.190
between the two routers.

07:20.200 --> 07:26.380
Now you might have to wait a while but notice we now see that the BGP relationship has come up and we

07:26.380 --> 07:34.160
can see that Rotto fall initiated to the BGP session to rodded 3.

07:34.210 --> 07:44.470
So that was different to what we saw previously previously rodder 3 initiated the session to rockfall

07:44.920 --> 07:50.810
that now run a four initiated session to Route 3.

07:50.860 --> 07:53.850
It doesn't matter who initiates the session.

07:54.190 --> 08:02.830
We simply want to see that the TCAP sessions are established and we want to see that

08:05.870 --> 08:10.200
BGP relationships are established between neighbors.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.190
Packet tracer shows this incorrectly.

08:13.190 --> 08:18.040
We see a blank in the real world when the sessions I step list here.

08:18.170 --> 08:25.520
So with packet tracer and in your exam make sure that you use the command show IP BGP neighbors and

08:25.550 --> 08:33.830
look for disestablished state to prove that the neighbor relationships are set up properly.

08:34.160 --> 08:40.400
If you see active Idol or any other word except established you have a problem.
