00:01.000 --> 00:12.150
So once again the loopback address of reform is Ford put forward for for We've been told that one cannot

00:12.150 --> 00:14.310
paying the Lupica of a full

00:17.320 --> 00:19.200
and as we can see that is true.

00:19.560 --> 00:27.040
Ken Rato one traced to the loop back of waterfall at the moment it doesn't look like a Rotto one is

00:27.060 --> 00:28.900
sending the traffic anyway.

00:29.190 --> 00:32.010
We don't see the trace route to go to rodded to

00:34.800 --> 00:38.920
do we have that network in IP writing table.

00:38.940 --> 00:40.440
No we don't.

00:40.440 --> 00:50.130
We only have connected and local networks in the IP writing table are we running a rotting protocol

00:50.490 --> 00:58.700
on the router show IP protocols shows us that yes we are running BGP on the router.

00:59.250 --> 01:02.360
Are we learning any routes through BGP.

01:02.370 --> 01:03.070
No.

01:03.450 --> 01:11.910
We only have routes advertised by the local router in the BGP writing table show IP BGP and neighbors.

01:12.060 --> 01:15.330
Do we have a neighbor relationships.

01:15.330 --> 01:24.770
Well we do have a neighbor configured as a to direct to donate to remote Autonomy's system number 65000.

01:24.800 --> 01:30.810
And two it's an external BGP relationship so that it looks good.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.060
The BJP state shows is active.

01:35.250 --> 01:37.940
Is that good or is that bad.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.500
And the answer is that is bad.

01:41.530 --> 01:46.560
It needs to show established for a neighbor relationship to be good.

01:48.510 --> 01:53.560
So be careful on a real BGP router.

01:54.000 --> 02:03.450
All on Jeana's 3 You won't see a blank in the output here packet traces shows a blank which implies

02:03.450 --> 02:11.310
that things are good but when you look at the neighbor relationship we see it as active which is bad.

02:11.340 --> 02:15.120
We don't want an active neighbor relationship.

02:15.120 --> 02:18.420
We want an established neighbor relationship.

02:18.690 --> 02:21.090
So there is the BGP configuration.

02:21.330 --> 02:24.350
Are we able to ping the neighbor.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.300
Yes we can.

02:26.310 --> 02:29.250
So this site looks good.

02:29.250 --> 02:39.450
What about router to so and router to show IP BGP summary Can you see the problem.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.630
What's the problem.

02:40.680 --> 02:56.420
Based on the Southport show IP BGP neighbors 15 1 1 2 shows up as established 8 8 8 8 shows up as active.

02:56.420 --> 03:00.820
What's the problem.

03:00.950 --> 03:13.350
The problem is this is the wrong IP address the IP address of Rotto one is a duty to do the dot one

03:13.610 --> 03:18.030
not a two door to door to door 8.

03:18.060 --> 03:21.900
So if we look at the configuration of BGP

03:24.870 --> 03:29.850
what we see is that the wrong neighbor has been configured.
