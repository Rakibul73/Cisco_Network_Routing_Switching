00:00.330 --> 00:10.740
So let's have a look at the BGP configuration of these rodders and write it to show run Evey's the BGP

00:10.740 --> 00:16.040
configuration on Grado three show run.

00:16.170 --> 00:18.190
Can you see the problem.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.100
What's the problem.

00:21.830 --> 00:22.970
Pause the video.

00:22.970 --> 00:26.100
Now if we need more time to find the problem.

00:26.750 --> 00:35.780
OK so notice here a neighbor 15 1 1 1 remote to tournament system sixty five thousand and four.

00:36.090 --> 00:38.100
That doesn't look right.

00:38.130 --> 00:42.200
Fifteen 1.1 one is in autonomous system.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.150
Number 65000 too.

00:45.230 --> 00:52.560
So what we should have is router BGP sixty five thousand three.

00:53.450 --> 00:56.290
So what we need to do is remove that neighbor.

00:57.380 --> 01:07.130
And what we should configure here is a neighbor relationship going to 65000 and to notices another problem

01:07.190 --> 01:17.090
we don't see the neighbor relationship come up show IP BGP neighbors shows us or maybe relationship

01:17.090 --> 01:22.640
to 17:1 one to as established and going down.

01:22.640 --> 01:28.380
We see a neighbor relationship established to 15 1 1 1 so that it looks better.

01:28.430 --> 01:33.410
The neighbor relationship is established but we should have got a notification back to the neighbor

01:33.410 --> 01:43.800
relationship came up should I be BGP neighbor on route to neighbor relationship 2 8 8 2 8 2 Daughter

01:43.800 --> 01:45.670
1 is established.

01:45.990 --> 01:51.770
So that's Rotto 1 neighbor relationship to 1 1 2.

01:51.780 --> 01:55.380
He's also established so that looks a lot better.

01:55.620 --> 02:05.970
Show IPV GP notice we see network 4 in the writing table and wrote to can now ping the loop back of

02:05.970 --> 02:15.450
rockfall and brought a one show IPB GP that the road appears in the BGP writing table and is also shown

02:16.020 --> 02:24.600
in the periodic table so we should be able to ping the loopback which we can on right for sure.

02:24.610 --> 02:26.040
My PBG p.

02:26.260 --> 02:28.930
We see the loop back of Route 1

02:31.720 --> 02:34.770
and we can ping the loop back of wrote a 1.

02:34.900 --> 02:43.610
So we've solved one of the problems in the network connectivity is now working but another problem is

02:43.610 --> 02:46.670
we don't see output on the con. of these routers

02:50.270 --> 02:52.820
and that's because I turned off

02:55.630 --> 02:58.530
logging con..

02:58.540 --> 03:09.100
I've added this command no logging console to the routers and I did that because otherwise you would

03:09.100 --> 03:11.860
see it was taking place.

03:11.860 --> 03:18.460
So what I'm going to do now is enable logging console on both routers

03:21.270 --> 03:23.890
and I'm going to reintroduce the problem.

03:24.300 --> 03:30.150
So I'm going to configure the neighbor relationship incorrectly.

03:30.150 --> 03:37.380
So what I'm going to do is remove the correct neighbor relationship

03:40.020 --> 03:43.020
and I'm going to make it.

03:43.020 --> 03:45.440
And that should be no.

03:46.080 --> 03:50.500
Notice what happens the neighbor relationship has gone down on both science.

03:50.580 --> 03:55.330
Why not introduce the wrong neighbor relationship.

03:55.340 --> 04:01.750
What we should see is an error like that peer in wrong antonymous system number.

04:01.820 --> 04:08.560
Notice we see hexadecimal values telling us that there's a problem with the neighbor relationship.

04:08.900 --> 04:18.280
And on this side we see that there's a peer neighbor relationship issue wrong autonomous system number.

04:18.430 --> 04:29.260
So I disabled logging so that you wouldn't see that problem which would make it too easy.

04:29.270 --> 04:35.570
So what I did is remove logging to the console to make it more difficult to find the problem in the

04:35.570 --> 04:36.700
real world.

04:37.010 --> 04:48.380
You're going to want to do logging con. all logging terminal so that you log on to the terminal so to

04:48.410 --> 04:57.170
moan like that when you telnet or S-sh to Rodda and in the global configuration we want to have a logging

04:57.170 --> 05:00.810
console so that we see output on the console.

05:00.890 --> 05:02.360
If you see no output.

05:02.570 --> 05:09.620
Don't forget to type to him mon or terminal monitor and make sure that logging Consul is enabled on

05:09.680 --> 05:13.970
the router so that you see what's happening in real time.

05:13.970 --> 05:20.280
Easiest way to test that is to go to a global config mode and type control Z or control it.

05:20.690 --> 05:23.290
You should see this on the console.

05:23.420 --> 05:31.040
If you don't see that that means that a logging to the console is disabled or you on a tenant sessional

05:31.140 --> 05:34.900
S-sh session and you haven't typed terminal monitor.

05:35.120 --> 05:38.610
So we successfully resolved this issue in the network.

05:38.690 --> 05:46.880
Once again Rodda one can ping the loopback of router for we can also use trace routes trace routes to

05:46.910 --> 05:48.970
the loopback of waterfall.

05:49.070 --> 05:54.620
You can see are going to write a to rodded three and then a of.

05:54.710 --> 06:03.950
So that looks good and wrote a for trace route to the loopback of wrote a one that looks good as well

06:04.670 --> 06:10.110
going to rodders 3 router 2 and then Rotto 1.

06:10.130 --> 06:14.540
So we've successfully solved the issues in this network.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.430
So that was an example of troubleshooting BGP.

06:17.630 --> 06:25.740
Remember in BGP both sides have to agree on all values just because I want to be your neighbor.

06:25.850 --> 06:28.870
Doesn't mean that you want to be my neighbor.

06:28.880 --> 06:34.880
When troubleshooting BGP make sure that the autonomous system numbers are configured correctly both

06:34.880 --> 06:40.490
sides have to agree on which IP addresses they will talk to and which Autonomy's system numbers they

06:40.490 --> 06:42.110
will talk to.

06:42.110 --> 06:47.110
I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope you found this troubleshooting lab useful.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.790
So how did you do.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.540
Were you able to solve the problems in this network.
