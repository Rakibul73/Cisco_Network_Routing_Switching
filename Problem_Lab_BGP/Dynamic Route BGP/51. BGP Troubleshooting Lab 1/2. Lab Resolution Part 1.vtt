WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:05.940
OK so let's check if we're being told the correct information.

00:05.940 --> 00:13.590
We've been told that right of one count paying it back over waterfall the loopback address off rockfall

00:14.020 --> 00:14.980
is Ford.

00:15.030 --> 00:17.980
Ford of 4.4.

00:18.300 --> 00:25.110
So we should be able to ping that IP address paying forward forward forward for at the moment it looks

00:25.110 --> 00:31.030
like we can't ping the loop back of Rodda four pings or timing out.

00:31.290 --> 00:35.410
So can we trace to forward forward forward for the trace.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.520
Doesn't seem to be going any way.

00:37.710 --> 00:45.750
So it doesn't even go to Rodda to in the typology that normally means that the road is not in the local

00:45.810 --> 00:47.220
routing table.

00:47.340 --> 00:55.690
Show IP route shows us that we don't see Ford or Ford or 4.4 in the local routing table.

00:56.130 --> 00:59.130
We do see some BGP routes.

00:59.370 --> 01:05.020
We see the loop back of water too and we see 15 1 1 0.

01:05.040 --> 01:14.490
This network in the writing table show IP BGP neighbors shows us that we have an established BGP relationship

01:14.820 --> 01:25.080
2 8 8 8 to 2 to show IP DGP shows us that we've got some BGP routes in the BGP writing table.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.810
We've got 8 2 8 8 2 0.

01:28.170 --> 01:30.700
The loopback of router to Toot.

01:30.780 --> 01:31.180
Toot.

01:31.200 --> 01:31.530
Toot.

01:31.560 --> 01:39.450
To which we can ping and 15 1 1 0 and we can also ping that address.

01:39.480 --> 01:46.770
So this network is in the writing table and we can ping 15 dog wondered wondered one can be ping 15

01:46.830 --> 01:48.800
at 1 to 1 to 2.

01:49.050 --> 01:50.580
No we can't.

01:50.580 --> 01:54.580
So in other words we can't ping from one to rodder three.

01:55.080 --> 01:56.670
Let's check on router too.

01:56.990 --> 02:01.580
Ken brought it to paying 15 one one two yes it can.

02:01.800 --> 02:05.330
So we have IP connectivity between router two and three.

02:05.340 --> 02:07.690
What about in router 3.

02:07.770 --> 02:13.320
Does it have network for in its routing table.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.120
Yes it does.

02:15.180 --> 02:24.600
So I notice this network is in the writing table and wrote 3 can ping the loopback of a waterfall but

02:24.600 --> 02:31.680
it looks like there's a problem here does it to have that rot in the writing table.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.480
No it doesn't.

02:33.480 --> 02:42.540
So in other words Rajshree is a learning about network for from Rotto for

02:45.420 --> 02:54.720
but it looks like rodder to he's not learning that network share IP BGP shows us that we've got network

02:54.720 --> 03:02.070
15 8 1 and 2 in the writing table but we don't have network 17.

03:02.070 --> 03:10.500
We don't have the loop back of free or the loop back over to 4 in the writing table but we can ping

03:11.840 --> 03:13.380
rodder 3.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.190
That means we probably go to BGP problem.

03:16.200 --> 03:29.240
So show IP BGP neighbors neighbor relationship 2 8 8 2 8 1 is established that looks good.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.760
Can you see a problem here.

03:35.030 --> 03:40.160
Notice a neighbor relationship to rodders 3 he's idle.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.520
That's definitely a problem.

03:42.650 --> 03:53.350
What about him rodder 3 show IP BGP neighbors neighbor relationship to 17:1 when t is established.

03:53.400 --> 03:59.330
Serrata three has a relationship to run a fall but the neighbor relationship to 15 wondered wondered

03:59.340 --> 04:01.050
one he's idle.

04:01.470 --> 04:08.910
But we can't paying 15 1 1 1 so it's not an IP connectivity problem.

04:08.940 --> 04:11.310
This looks like a BGP problem.
