00:00.640 --> 00:08.790
The I on the right hand side means that the network command was used to advertise the route into BGP.

00:09.010 --> 00:13.630
If you see a question mark here it means that redistribution was used.

00:13.690 --> 00:16.590
We can also see the autonomy system Porth.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.020
This is a list of autonomous system part of that.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.790
The Rock went through for this route.

00:21.790 --> 00:27.940
There isn't an autonomous system path because of this router was originated in the local autonomous

00:27.940 --> 00:29.130
system.

00:29.140 --> 00:39.040
This route however originated what was advertised from this autonomous system 65000 to the same is true

00:39.070 --> 00:41.590
for 15 1 1 0.

00:41.920 --> 00:46.330
That route originated in a tunnel system.

00:46.330 --> 00:50.350
So we should be able to ping the loop back of route too.

00:51.160 --> 00:57.870
And thats true because the route is found in the BJP routing table because it's a valid route.

00:58.030 --> 01:02.030
It's added to the IP routing table as follows.

01:02.140 --> 01:04.420
Via a BGP.

01:04.420 --> 01:09.500
And because of that I can ping the loopback of router 2.

01:09.850 --> 01:18.380
So we've successfully configured BGP between wrote a one in to in the same way router 2 has learnt about

01:18.380 --> 01:20.610
this loop back through BGP.

01:20.960 --> 01:28.490
So show IP BGP shows us that this network was learnt from this router which is Router one we can see

01:28.490 --> 01:35.330
the autonomous system Porth it originated in a tunnel system number 65000 one the next top Rodda it

01:35.330 --> 01:41.180
is 8 8 8 1 so we should be able to ping wondered.

01:41.260 --> 01:47.990
Wondered wondered one which we can so we've successfully configured BGP between these two routers and

01:47.990 --> 01:49.570
testor to connectivity.

01:49.910 --> 01:55.370
Now lets configure BGP to Rodda three.

01:55.460 --> 01:57.830
So run a BGP 65000 to

02:00.840 --> 02:07.480
neighbor 15 1 1 2 remote 2 autonomous system is sixty five thousand three.

02:07.500 --> 02:17.570
So show IP BGP and neber what you'll notice is the neighbor relationship 2 8 2 8 8 2 1 is established.

02:17.760 --> 02:26.090
But if we scroll or down notice the neighbor relationship to 15 1 1 2 is active.

02:26.090 --> 02:28.850
That means it's not working.

02:28.850 --> 02:32.190
Active means there's a problem.

02:32.190 --> 02:34.850
Show IP BGP summary.

02:34.850 --> 02:44.220
In the real world on a real router you'll see something like active here rather than a blank spec trace

02:44.230 --> 02:46.000
it doesn't show that correctly.

02:46.340 --> 02:53.930
But we can see that the status is active by using the show IP BGP neighbors command.

02:53.930 --> 02:56.810
So notice the state is active not established.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.500
That means it's not working.

02:59.810 --> 03:01.800
So I'm rodder three.

03:01.910 --> 03:06.590
We need to configure BGP to form the neighbor relationship.

03:06.770 --> 03:12.720
Again just because I want to be your neighbor doesn't mean you want to be my neighbor.

03:12.980 --> 03:20.420
Both sides have to be configured and have to be configured correctly for the neighbor relationship to

03:20.420 --> 03:21.700
come up.

03:21.980 --> 03:26.580
Now that both sides are configured correctly the neighbor relationship has come up.

03:26.690 --> 03:36.540
So show IP BGP neighbors scrolling down neighbor relationship from router to to router 3.

03:36.740 --> 03:47.680
Now shows established it's been up for 14 seconds so on wrote three let's advertise the loopback address.

03:47.690 --> 03:50.660
That's using a slash 32 mosque.

03:50.780 --> 03:57.260
We can prove that by using show IP ront noticed there's the rot in the running table.

03:58.580 --> 04:11.150
We can also advertise other interfaces on the router such as 15 wondered wondered she arose with the

04:11.150 --> 04:19.120
right mosque and 17:1 1 0 with the correct mosque.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.500
Show i.p wrong again.

04:22.830 --> 04:28.590
15 is using slushed 24 mosque 17 is using a slash 24 mosque.

04:28.980 --> 04:35.650
What you'll notice here as well is we already have BGP rots in the writing table or rodder 3.

04:36.060 --> 04:37.790
So show PBG P..

04:37.990 --> 04:41.400
There's the local BGP writing table on Route 3.

04:41.730 --> 04:50.140
This network which is the loop back of Route 1 is being advertised to rodders 3 from rodder 2.

04:50.160 --> 04:57.690
With this being the next top 15 wondered wondered one the autonomy system Porth wrote originated in

04:57.690 --> 04:59.660
sixty five thousand one.

04:59.730 --> 05:06.440
Then it went through sixty five thousand two and then it arrived at our autonomous system.

05:06.480 --> 05:14.130
The route is a valid notice over there so that means we should be able to ping the loopback of Route

05:14.190 --> 05:18.850
1 which we can debug.

05:19.750 --> 05:23.850
IP ICMP do that ping again.

05:23.940 --> 05:34.210
Notice we see the output of the debug wrote of one is sending a reply back to 15 1 1 2 which is this

05:34.310 --> 05:36.360
interface on router 3.

05:36.770 --> 05:43.980
So the show IP rot routing table looks good Lupica wrote a one loop back of Ratatouille.

05:44.270 --> 05:49.230
We've got this network 8 2 8 8 0 in the writing table so we should.

05:49.250 --> 05:56.150
As an example be able to paying the address as well as that address which we can so Rodda 3 has been

05:56.150 --> 05:57.660
successfully configured.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.810
Now we need to configure Rotto for.
