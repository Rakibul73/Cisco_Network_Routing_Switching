00:00.420 --> 00:12.330
So write a full show IP protocols no protocols of running at the moment rota BGP 65000 for nevus 17

00:13.040 --> 00:14.790
1 1 2 remote.

00:14.840 --> 00:23.680
Yes 65000 and 3 and put the wrong IP address they should be 17 1 1 1.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.140
Now what's the problem.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.980
What have I got to do.

00:27.190 --> 00:34.490
I forgot to configure rodder three with 4S details

00:37.340 --> 00:39.570
so I need to do the site as well.

00:39.810 --> 00:43.490
Otherwise the neighbor relationship won't come up.

00:45.460 --> 00:45.730
So

00:48.370 --> 00:58.810
17:1 want to promote a yes 65000 full notice the neighbor relationship has come up.

00:58.940 --> 01:03.430
It's really important to have your documentation right on the site.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.650
Notice that neighbor relationship has come up as well.

01:06.650 --> 01:09.810
So let's advertise the loopback address.

01:11.550 --> 01:13.620
Notice I should specify the mosque

01:17.040 --> 01:21.000
and I can also advertise 17 1 1 0 with the mosque.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.330
You don't have to advertise them both sites but you can do that.

01:26.360 --> 01:31.020
So show IP BGP we are seeing results in the writing table.

01:31.340 --> 01:36.580
These eight these 15 to 17.

01:36.800 --> 01:43.220
Again you don't have to advertise on both sides but you can do that in case one of the broadcast goes

01:43.220 --> 01:47.000
down or an interface goes down in your network.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.310
If multiple routers advertise you have redundancy.

01:50.430 --> 01:55.670
So notice this network and all expand the console window.

01:57.880 --> 02:02.130
Network originated in the autonomy system.

02:02.290 --> 02:09.450
Then it went through this autonomous system then through this autonomy system and then the local autonomous

02:09.450 --> 02:13.690
system received the route the route is valid.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.120
Next hop is the router.

02:16.510 --> 02:22.420
So we should be able to ping the loopback of thought of one which we can we should be able to trace

02:22.620 --> 02:33.250
the loop back to one which we can traffic went to route history right it to and then wrote a one in

02:33.250 --> 02:42.650
the same way show IP BGP on route one shows us the loop back of Rato for the network originated in this

02:42.670 --> 02:49.660
autonomy system went through those autonomous system then the autonomy system and was then received

02:49.660 --> 02:52.230
by the local autonomous system.

02:52.240 --> 02:59.370
The rot was advertised by Rodda to second rate of one paying the loopback of waterfall.

02:59.530 --> 03:00.640
Yes it can.

03:00.670 --> 03:03.070
Can we trace to the loopback of waterfall.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.410
Yes we can.

03:04.720 --> 03:10.440
So weve successfully configured this network with BGP.

03:10.540 --> 03:11.930
How did you do.

03:11.950 --> 03:15.490
Were you able to configure the network and get it working.

03:15.580 --> 03:23.340
Make sure that you can before you go for your CCMA exam the next video is a troubleshooting video.

03:23.440 --> 03:28.060
Make sure that you can troubleshoot BGP before taking your exam.
