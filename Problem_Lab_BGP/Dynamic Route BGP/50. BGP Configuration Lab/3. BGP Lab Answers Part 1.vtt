00:00.110 --> 00:04.380
In the apology I'm using public IP version 4 addresses.

00:04.380 --> 00:08.390
You can see a list of assigned IP version for addresses on Wikipedia.

00:09.410 --> 00:18.760
The Sadrist bloc 8 8 8 0 belongs to level 3 15 belongs to HP and 17 belongs to Apple.

00:18.890 --> 00:27.440
But we're going to use those address blocks in our network to simulate a BGP network running on the

00:27.440 --> 00:32.190
Internet of configurator the topology with basic IP addressing.

00:32.420 --> 00:40.230
So what we need to do here is configure BGP show IP interface brief shows us that with the addresses

00:40.290 --> 00:50.270
configured on gigabit 0 0 0 on Rotto 1 and those loopback addresses configured on Grada one can write

00:50.270 --> 00:52.420
a one paying Rodda too.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.390
Yes it can.

00:54.410 --> 01:02.320
So we have IP connectivity between Route 1 and router to router to also has a loopback address to configure

01:02.310 --> 01:09.630
it of to to to to to to to and IP addresses configured on the ethernet interfaces.

01:09.820 --> 01:21.910
The same is true 2:56 Lubeck address of 3.3 to 3.3 with IP addresses on Ethan and interfaces.

01:21.910 --> 01:31.420
And lastly the same thing is configured for rotifer has a loopback address configured as well as an

01:31.420 --> 01:33.900
IP address on the gigabit interface.

01:34.030 --> 01:43.220
So lets configure BGP in global configuration mode router BGP.

01:43.600 --> 01:50.370
We need to specify an autonomous system number you know example it's 65000 and 1.

01:50.410 --> 01:59.230
Now unlike IGP such as Eli GOP and always P.F. we have to manually configure a neighbor relationships

01:59.670 --> 02:08.890
in BGP in BGP we use the concept just because I want to be your neighbor it doesn't mean that you want

02:08.890 --> 02:10.130
to be my neighbor.

02:10.360 --> 02:17.080
So both sides need to be configured statically with the IP address of the neighbor to form neighbor

02:17.080 --> 02:19.190
relationships with.

02:19.240 --> 02:27.020
We then need to specify the remote autonomous system which in this example is 65000 too.

02:27.320 --> 02:31.380
So that's how you configure neighbor relationships and BGP.

02:31.580 --> 02:38.950
We can then advertise networks so network and specify and network.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.900
Now this is a really important.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.710
You need to specify a mosque.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.780
This is not an inverse mosque.

02:45.780 --> 02:51.300
This is a mosque based on the route in the writing table.

02:51.300 --> 03:00.090
So show IP wrote shows us that we have a slash 32 network directly connected that's the IP address configured

03:00.120 --> 03:01.890
on Lubec 0.

03:01.980 --> 03:09.060
So show run shows us that this IP address is configured on the loopback and it appears in the writing

03:09.060 --> 03:12.450
table as follows.

03:12.450 --> 03:22.770
That means that when we configure BGP we must configure BGP with the correct IP address and mask in

03:22.770 --> 03:27.260
exactly the same way as it appears in the writing table.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.590
Slash 32 mosque.

03:30.730 --> 03:35.690
So we use a slash 32 mosque here.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.350
So let's advertise

03:40.030 --> 03:46.780
network 8 8 8 8 0 with the mosque for that network.

03:46.810 --> 03:50.640
Notice its not an inverse mosque.

03:50.750 --> 03:52.500
It's a stented mosque.

03:52.850 --> 04:00.990
Again that's based on this information as shown in the writing table.

04:01.040 --> 04:04.090
So that's how you configure basic BGP.

04:04.480 --> 04:11.540
You specify your autonomous system number you specify your neighbor with the autonomous system number

04:13.670 --> 04:16.860
and then you advertise Rantz into the BGP writing table.
