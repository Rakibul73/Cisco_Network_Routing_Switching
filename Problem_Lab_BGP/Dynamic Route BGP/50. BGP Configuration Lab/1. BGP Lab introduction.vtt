This is limited to pairing and routed Vota spent using the network command only BGP is an exterior gateway

00:57.750 --> 01:06.570
protocol or aegypti that is different to protocols such as E.I. GOP always P.F. which are IGP is also

01:06.570 --> 01:15.960
called internal gateway protocols Steria gateway protocols such as BGP are used between autonomous systems

01:16.540 --> 01:23.240
whereas IGP are used within autonomous systems BGP is used on the Internet.

01:23.280 --> 01:28.620
They are two versions of BGP BGP and BGP.

01:28.710 --> 01:37.890
GP is the focus of the CCN a course e BGP runs between autonomy systems and IBG can be used within an

01:37.890 --> 01:47.880
autonomy system in a similar way to OSPF or E-I GOP BGP is a very large topic and you can spend many

01:47.880 --> 01:52.010
hours and many days studying BGP BGP.

01:52.010 --> 01:56.940
However for the CCMA is limited to this use case.

01:56.940 --> 02:04.410
