In this package a Trace it typology I have full rodders Rato one writer to write a story and wrote a

00:07.290 --> 00:14.910
for each router in their own autonomy system number sixty five thousand one sixty five thousand two

00:15.120 --> 00:25.570
three and four BGP once again consists of two protocols I BGP and e BGP packet a tracer only supports

So we'll only configure BGP in those topology.

00:37.440 --> 00:44.190

00:52.680 --> 01:00.870
for if you can ping from the Luebeck of wrote a one to the loopback of wrote a for and back again it
