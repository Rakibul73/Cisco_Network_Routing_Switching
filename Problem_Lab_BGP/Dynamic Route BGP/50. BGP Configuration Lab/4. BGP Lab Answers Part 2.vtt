WEBVTT

00:00.740 --> 00:10.300
So let's configure rockety show IP protocols shows that you know writing protocols are currently enabled

00:10.300 --> 00:21.500
on the router so Rhonda BGP 65000 into neighbor 8 8 8 to 1 remote autonomy system sixty five thousand

00:21.510 --> 00:29.150
one notice we see that a BGP relationship has come up on both sides.

00:30.060 --> 00:31.710
So show IPB GP neighbors

00:34.440 --> 00:41.760
scrolling up we can see that a neighbor relationship is established now BGP is different to other routing

00:41.760 --> 00:42.860
protocols.

00:42.990 --> 00:47.530
If you see an active relationship that means it's not working.

00:47.730 --> 00:52.440
You need to see stablished B.G. people go through different states.

00:52.440 --> 00:59.910
If you see a neighbor relationship of idle or active or anything else apart from established it means

00:59.910 --> 01:01.160
you have a problem.

01:01.230 --> 01:07.940
You must see stablished the BJP state for a working and liberation ship is established.

01:08.020 --> 01:15.390
So make sure you look for established we can see a BGP neighbor is 8 8 8 2 2 autonomous system number

01:15.520 --> 01:17.320
65000 to.

01:17.610 --> 01:20.010
It's an external BGP relationship.

01:20.010 --> 01:22.340
In other words it's using BGP.

01:22.560 --> 01:26.820
We are in a different autonomous system to our neighbor.

01:27.030 --> 01:29.970
Again make sure that you look for this.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.200
We are using BGP version 4.

01:32.490 --> 01:36.390
That's the version of BGP that we currently use.

01:36.390 --> 01:44.070
It's kind of like always a version to a whisper version 3 but the current release of BGP version for

01:45.330 --> 01:55.190
remote broader ID is to to to to to to to the Rodda ID selected in a similar way to always PFM the GOP.

01:55.230 --> 02:00.800
It's the IP address or the loopback interface.

02:00.820 --> 02:03.160
A lot of information is shown in that command

02:07.370 --> 02:10.590
the big thing to look for is show I be BGP neighbors.

02:10.670 --> 02:14.000
Is that the neighbor relationship is established.

02:14.270 --> 02:21.980
So state is established now BJP also has the command to show IP BGP summary what you should see at the

02:21.980 --> 02:24.410
end here is that it's blank.

02:24.440 --> 02:29.080
If you see a word like Idol or active It means you have a problem.

02:29.300 --> 02:35.010
It needs to be blank and you'll see something like state prefixes received.

02:35.180 --> 02:37.470
So how many rants are you receiving from your neighbor.

02:39.020 --> 02:42.370
And how long has that neighbor relationship been up.

02:42.470 --> 02:49.250
We can see we've got a neighbor to direct it to the to TV version of BGP version for Tynemouth system

02:49.370 --> 02:53.150
number of the neighbors 65000 to packet trace.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.950
It is a simulator.

02:54.980 --> 02:58.570
It's not perfect but it's good enough for CCMA.

02:58.760 --> 03:06.150
So some information here won't be exactly the same as a real router but it's enough for exam preparation.

03:07.740 --> 03:15.390
So on this router let's advertise the lookback so network to to to to to to to the mosque should be

03:15.490 --> 03:17.260
I-Slash 32 mosque.

03:17.910 --> 03:32.830
And we can also advertise the network as well as the 15 network noticed she must set the mosque here

03:33.000 --> 03:36.600
exactly the way it appears in the writing table.

03:36.660 --> 03:46.210
So the two network is using a slash 32 8 network is a slash 24 15 network is a slash 24.

03:46.530 --> 03:58.800
So again when we look at the BGP configuration slash 24 here Sless 24 is huge here to show IP BGP notice

03:58.800 --> 04:02.250
we are learning routes through BGP.

04:02.380 --> 04:11.340
Are learning about the 8 2 8 8 0 network and the 15 that wondered 1.0 network BGP has its own writing

04:11.340 --> 04:14.700
table in addition to the IP writing table.

04:15.060 --> 04:21.560
So we have the stented IP writing table and noticed we are learning about 15 not one that one touch

04:21.570 --> 04:22.560
zero.

04:22.650 --> 04:27.480
So we should be able to ping 15 wondered wondered one which we can

04:30.320 --> 04:37.820
but not we have the stented IP writing table but we also have the BGP writing table which contains networks

04:37.880 --> 04:41.410
that have been locally advertised.

04:41.480 --> 04:48.980
That means that we used the network command or redistribution on the local router to advertise that

04:48.980 --> 04:51.320
network into the BGP routing table.

04:51.710 --> 04:57.670
This network was advertised by our own neighbor 8 8 8 2.

04:58.040 --> 05:04.190
This network was advertised both by the local router as well as by the neighbor.

05:04.190 --> 05:12.020
You'll learn about weights and other BGP metrics such as local preference and made or metric in more

05:12.020 --> 05:14.390
advanced BGP courses.

05:14.810 --> 05:17.740
But for CCMA you don't need to worry too much about that.

05:18.050 --> 05:24.580
But notice the weight here is this value which is very high compared to this.

05:24.830 --> 05:30.980
And that's because this network was advertised by the local router this network was advertised by another

05:30.980 --> 05:31.820
router.

05:32.150 --> 05:39.470
The higher the weight the more believable or the more reliable a route as is often the case we believe

05:39.470 --> 05:41.690
ourselves more than others.

05:41.750 --> 05:51.380
So noodles for this network this is the best route greater than sign we believe ourselves more than

05:51.380 --> 05:55.950
we believe others and that's because it has a higher weight.

05:56.110 --> 06:02.620
So the local route takes precedence over a remote advertisement.
