00:00.330 --> 00:07.080
So we've been told that one can't ping a waterfall it can ping the loopback of a waterfall and that

00:07.080 --> 00:08.220
looks correct.

00:08.490 --> 00:12.040
Can we trace to the loopback of wrote a file.

00:12.150 --> 00:15.640
It looks like we can't trace trace route.

00:15.690 --> 00:18.600
He's not showing any next tops.

00:18.660 --> 00:21.030
In other words we're not seeing router 2.

00:21.300 --> 00:24.200
We simply seeing packets being dropped.

00:24.220 --> 00:26.170
Show IP BGP.

00:26.250 --> 00:33.090
We also don't have network for the BJP running table but we do see network 15.

00:33.090 --> 00:35.680
In other words we see this network.

00:35.930 --> 00:39.690
So can we ping 15 of one to one or two.

00:40.290 --> 00:44.010
That's the IP address doesn't look like we can.

00:44.220 --> 00:47.160
So we can ping rodder three.

00:47.160 --> 00:47.560
Can we.

00:47.570 --> 00:50.390
Paying Rodek to.

00:50.460 --> 00:51.900
Yes we can.

00:51.900 --> 01:00.000
So in other words we can get from one to the network but we can ping the IP address.

01:00.270 --> 01:08.270
Now on router to see a lot of problems with getting BGP notifications here stating that the neighbor

01:08.650 --> 01:15.380
15 at one end and one or two is in the wrong Autonomy's system.

01:15.420 --> 01:21.820
So based on those output do you know how to fix the network.

01:21.960 --> 01:30.190
When we look at raw history we also see problems notifications are being received from 17:1 one 2 which

01:30.190 --> 01:35.970
has wrought a fall and notifications are being received from 15 1 1 1.

01:35.970 --> 01:41.940
Now when we receive the BJP notification it means that the neighbor relationship is being torn down

01:42.350 --> 01:48.990
when other words reset the neighbor relationship will not come up when a neighbor relationship is reset

01:50.490 --> 01:59.940
so the fact that rotisseries getting those messages from both wrote a full and Rodda to tells us that

01:59.940 --> 02:03.570
theres probably an issue on route three.

02:03.720 --> 02:12.120
Now the fact that we also getting those messages means that we have IP communication to those two routers

02:12.630 --> 02:16.200
and we can prove that by doing pings which work

02:20.520 --> 02:25.030
so have a look at the configuration can you see the problem.

02:25.200 --> 02:29.030
What's the problem in this configuration.

02:29.040 --> 02:33.740
Let's have a look at route a TV show run.

02:33.880 --> 02:37.260
They brought it to his rotisserie.

02:37.390 --> 02:39.250
What's the problem.

02:40.560 --> 02:48.430
Notice rotisseries trying to form a relationship to 15 1 1 to this IP address to a neighbor in Autonomy's

02:48.480 --> 02:52.480
system which is correct per hour diagram.

02:52.500 --> 03:00.780
But when we look at rotisserie we see that BGP is configured in autonomous system number sixty five

03:00.870 --> 03:09.090
thousand five so the wrong autonomous system number has been configured so show IP BGP neighbors an

03:09.090 --> 03:23.130
example shows us that the neighbor relationships are idle 15 one on one is idle 17 1 1 2 idle the neighbor

03:23.130 --> 03:30.470
relationships are being reset because of the wrong Autonomy's system numbers configured now noticed

03:30.500 --> 03:41.210
what happens if I try and enable BGP an autonomous system number 65000 three BGP can only run in one

03:41.210 --> 03:42.820
autonomous system.

03:42.860 --> 03:46.400
So we told that BGP is already running.

03:46.400 --> 03:57.770
So we need to remove the BGP 65000 5 and then enable BGP in the Thomas system number and then we can

03:57.770 --> 04:00.760
paste the configuration back in.

04:01.130 --> 04:09.540
And notice we can see that neighbor relationships have now come up so show I.P DGP neighbors on rodders

04:09.560 --> 04:17.490
three we can see that 15 1 1 1 which is wrong too.

04:17.780 --> 04:22.460
He's now established 17 1 1 2.

04:22.600 --> 04:26.560
He's now established neighbor relationships up.

04:26.960 --> 04:35.260
So show IP BGP we all learning Roths wrote a three can ping the loop back of Route 1 and it can ping

04:35.530 --> 04:39.470
the loopback or proto full that looks a lot better.

04:39.760 --> 04:48.900
So it can run a one ping the loopback of wrote a full Yes it can so trace to run a full trace works.

04:50.820 --> 05:03.120
On wrote a full paying loop back over out of one trace to write a one both ping and trace complete successfully.

05:03.120 --> 05:08.070
So we've now resolved the problem in the network.

05:08.160 --> 05:15.690
If you see messages like these BGP notification peer Imraan autonomy system number it means that either

05:15.690 --> 05:23.160
your neighbor relationship is configured incorrectly or that the local BGP autonomous system number

05:23.700 --> 05:30.710
has been incorrectly configured so check your neighbor's statements and check your local BGP Turnham

05:30.710 --> 05:35.280
system number both sides have to be configured correctly.

05:37.090 --> 05:41.270
With values that are agreed upon by both sides.

05:41.350 --> 05:46.780
If either side is configured incorrectly the BGP relationship will not come up.
