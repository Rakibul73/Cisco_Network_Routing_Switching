It now for other writers to get to this network.

00:03.410 --> 00:10.750
This network needs to be up and it needs to be advertised via the routing protocol which in this example

00:10.750 --> 00:19.540
is BGP so we can see that the network is up up the local Rodek can paying for that for that 4.4.

00:19.750 --> 00:29.450
So it looks like the network is up but is the network being advertised through BGP show IP BGP shows

00:29.450 --> 00:36.160
us the local BGP running table and notice we don't see the full network in the BJP running table.

00:36.500 --> 00:41.730
So it looks like there's a problem with BGP on the local Rodda.

00:41.800 --> 00:47.570
So show run can you see the problem.

00:47.570 --> 00:57.410
What's the problem with the configuration and to help you I'll use the command show IP rot pipe include

00:57.410 --> 00:58.800
fall.

00:58.970 --> 01:06.710
So there's the network in the IP writing table and there is the BGP configuration.

01:06.710 --> 01:07.880
What's wrong.
