00:00.900 --> 00:04.760
Can you see the problem with this configuration.

00:04.770 --> 00:09.330
So firstly note that a network is being advertised in BGP.

00:09.630 --> 00:14.220
But look at the subnet mask on the loopback interface.

00:14.220 --> 00:18.020
This is a Slusher 32 network.

00:18.060 --> 00:21.590
So again show run.

00:21.690 --> 00:30.840
Notice the subnet mask on the loopback interface and then look at the subnet mask on the BJP configuration.

00:30.840 --> 00:39.720
Now this is a very important difference between BGP and IGP as such as Eli GOP and OSPF the network

00:39.750 --> 00:50.520
command does not enable BGP on an interface the network command looks for this network in the IP routing

00:50.520 --> 00:57.650
table and if there's an exact match it will advertise that network through BGP.

00:57.980 --> 01:08.760
So show IP route shows us that network fall is in the IP writing table but the subnet mask is different.

01:08.820 --> 01:11.670
It's not a slice 24 subnet.

01:11.670 --> 01:20.270
So this network or doesn't appear in the IP writing table remember BGP is looking for an exact prefix.

01:20.400 --> 01:28.170
In other words the network portion and the subnet mask have to match exactly which they don't.

01:28.170 --> 01:33.380
In this example this is a Slusher 32.

01:33.530 --> 01:35.410
This is a slash 24.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.140
So there isn't a match.

01:39.010 --> 01:46.240
So even though the route appears in the operating table it's not added to the BGP routing table because

01:46.240 --> 01:48.570
there isn't an exact match.

01:51.380 --> 02:05.780
So let's fix our BGP configuration Subrata BGP 65000 for no network Forder for dot dot 4.0 mosque 2

02:05.780 --> 02:10.000
4 5 2 5 5 5 0.

02:10.040 --> 02:21.840
This needs to be network $4.40 for Mosque slash 32.

02:21.940 --> 02:24.840
So now show IP BGP.

02:24.850 --> 02:33.160
Notice that a network is in the BJP writing table the local Rodda is advertising the network.

02:33.160 --> 02:41.200
So what we should see here is that previously we didn't have a network for in the IP writing table but

02:41.200 --> 02:48.390
now we do on Rotto one can write a one ping the loop back of.

02:48.580 --> 02:50.200
Yes it can.

02:50.260 --> 03:00.210
That route has been advertised via a BGP route a one received the route from router to router to is

03:00.220 --> 03:08.000
the next top but the network originated in a tournament system sixty five thousand four.

03:08.050 --> 03:14.470
Then it went to a tournament system sixty five thousand three eventa sixty five thousand two and was

03:14.470 --> 03:21.790
advertised by a 2 8 8 or 2 2 Rato one because of the road is valid.

03:21.790 --> 03:32.590
In other words the next top is ping a bull that the round is added to the IP routing table which means

03:32.590 --> 03:40.900
that we can ping the loop back over waterfall and if we do a trace we see that the trace goes through

03:40.900 --> 03:44.880
the network via router 2 3 and 4.

03:45.190 --> 03:49.300
So weve successfully solved the problem in this network.

03:49.300 --> 03:59.040
The big takeaway here or the big thing to remember is the network command in BGP is not like network

03:59.060 --> 04:04.810
commands in OSPF for the GOP or other IGP.

04:05.490 --> 04:15.520
The network command tells BGP to look for an exact match of that network in the IP writing table.

04:15.520 --> 04:24.250
If it finds that network then it advertises it through BGP to neighboring routers but it has to be an

04:24.250 --> 04:25.860
exact match.

04:25.870 --> 04:27.340
So how did you do.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.200
Were you able to solve this.

04:29.380 --> 04:38.530
Remember BGP is an external or exterior gateway routing protocol BGP doesn't work like other routing

04:38.530 --> 04:41.950
protocols BGP is a very big subject.

04:42.020 --> 04:49.330
But for the and a course you just need to know the basics of BGP hoopy finding these troubleshooting

04:49.330 --> 04:50.290
videos useful.
