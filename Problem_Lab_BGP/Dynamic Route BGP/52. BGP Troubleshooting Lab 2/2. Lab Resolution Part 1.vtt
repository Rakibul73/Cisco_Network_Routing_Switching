00:00.450 --> 00:10.670
So in this network we've been told that Araud of one is not able to ping the loop back of Rato for this

00:10.670 --> 00:21.730
is the IP address of waterfalls loopback paying for 4.4 as we can see the ping doesn't succeed.

00:21.820 --> 00:24.270
It doesn't look like it's getting to four.

00:24.670 --> 00:26.200
Let's see how far it gets.

00:26.230 --> 00:29.450
So all trace to the loop back of rockfall.

00:29.680 --> 00:34.320
And in this example it looks like it's not even leaving the local router.

00:34.600 --> 00:40.760
We don't see the traffic get to router to route three or route.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.010
It just times out.

00:43.060 --> 00:50.110
So let's check if that route isn't the writing table the local router will simply drop the packets if

00:50.110 --> 00:52.570
the route is not in the wrong table.

00:52.630 --> 01:02.460
And as we can see that route is not in one's writing table is it in the BGP table as we can see it's

01:02.460 --> 01:10.860
not if the route is not learnt through BGP it's not going to be added to the operating table which means

01:10.860 --> 01:18.210
you won't be able to ping or send traffic to that network the local router will simply drop the traffic

01:18.270 --> 01:20.580
to that remote network.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.300
And that's what we are seeing here.

01:24.300 --> 01:32.160
So again without a rat in the IP writing table traffic is simply dropped routing protocols such as BGP

01:33.150 --> 01:42.350
add routes to the IP writing table the only routing protocol that we currently have enabled is BGP BGP

01:42.360 --> 01:49.960
seems to be working because we are receiving Roths in the BJP writing table as an example.

01:50.070 --> 01:52.060
We are learning about this network.

01:52.110 --> 02:02.270
We are learning about network show IP BGP summary shows us that we have a neighbor relationship to 8

02:02.570 --> 02:04.640
8 8 to 2.

02:04.850 --> 02:08.230
We are receiving routes from that neighbor.

02:08.240 --> 02:17.930
So again show IP BGP we can see routes have been advertised by that neighbor to the local router and

02:17.930 --> 02:19.160
we can ping

02:22.610 --> 02:26.400
17:1 one too which is Rato full.

02:26.420 --> 02:36.050
So at this point it looks like they may be a problem on Grado 4 because we can get to route for as shown

02:36.050 --> 02:37.730
by the trace route.

02:38.120 --> 02:45.120
So traffic going to 17 one 1 2 goes to router 2 then router 3 then run a full

02:48.270 --> 02:53.250
but we dont have 4.4 for that for in the running table.

02:53.310 --> 02:57.840
So lets have a look on Grada for to see if we can find a problem.
