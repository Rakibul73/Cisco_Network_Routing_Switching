WEBVTT

00:00.790 --> 00:09.490
So on wrote a full show IP interface brief IP addresses look good.

00:09.570 --> 00:13.000
There's the loop back serial interface.

00:13.390 --> 00:19.330
Gigabit 0 wanting to face and gigabit 00 interface

00:22.120 --> 00:33.850
serrata BGP 65000 for neighbor 8 8 to do it for that one remote to transmit system 65000 to neighbor

00:33.940 --> 00:37.020
8 8 DOD 7.1.

00:37.030 --> 00:47.560
We have to configure two relationships to Rodek two and then enable toll 1 1 1 remote to time the system

00:47.560 --> 00:51.520
number sixty five thousand three.

00:51.610 --> 00:58.110
That's the relationship to rodder 3.

00:58.320 --> 01:04.390
And then we can advertise networks so we can advertise all loopback interface.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.770
We can advertise HD 4.0

01:12.690 --> 01:23.650
advertise 8 8 7 0 advertise 12 1 1 0.

01:23.850 --> 01:27.540
It's a show I PBG at the moment shows nothing.

01:27.540 --> 01:34.900
Let's set up the neighbor relationships on Broadway two and three and hopefully that will fix the problem.

01:35.250 --> 01:48.020
Like it wrote a one song brought it to Rada BGP 65000 to neighbor a steady diet for the two remote to

01:48.120 --> 01:58.170
the system is 65000 for neighbor relationship has come up a toll a 7.2 remote autonomous system number

01:58.680 --> 02:04.730
65000 for neighbor relationship has come up.

02:04.950 --> 02:09.380
So show IP BGP summary.

02:09.420 --> 02:16.950
We've got three BGP neighbors configured so that gets rid of three

02:21.870 --> 02:24.300
confetti rodded BGP

02:26.150 --> 02:28.210
65000 and three

02:31.120 --> 02:42.650
Neva toll 1 1 2 remote autonomous system 65000 for neighbor relationships come up so the show IP BGP

02:42.650 --> 02:44.330
summary.

02:44.580 --> 02:49.190
We've got two neighbor relationships can forget.

02:49.510 --> 02:56.010
So at this point a broader one should hopefully have learnt about the rot of for's routes through rodded

02:56.030 --> 02:58.220
two and router 3.

02:58.650 --> 03:01.890
So notice there's the BGP routing table.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.930
We can see the loop back of Radio 4.

03:05.110 --> 03:07.130
It was learnt from 8 8 8.

03:07.150 --> 03:10.380
Took 2 which is Roger 3.

03:10.390 --> 03:15.910
It was also learnt from 12 0 0 2 which is router 3

03:18.580 --> 03:23.640
so one has learnt about this network from two neighbors.

03:23.830 --> 03:30.490
It originated in this autonomous system but has traversed this autonomy system and has traversed this

03:30.490 --> 03:32.800
autonomy system to get to us.

03:32.800 --> 03:43.400
We've got two routes to the Neva So we've got two routes to get to rockfall we can ping Rodda four and

03:43.460 --> 03:52.160
the trace shows us that it goes via a direct to the right to talk to BGP has a complex criteria for

03:52.160 --> 03:53.960
determining the best route.

03:53.960 --> 04:00.970
We're not going to worry too much about that in this course notice though that the best route is being

04:00.970 --> 04:03.010
put into the Oppy table.

04:03.070 --> 04:06.150
It's going via rodded too.

04:06.160 --> 04:13.180
In other words a to ready to talk to so that looks good can we paying the loop back to three.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.490
Yes we can.

04:14.490 --> 04:16.190
What about the lead back of Rodda to.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.030
Yes we can.

04:18.190 --> 04:32.600
So I brought a for has learnt about of one show I PBG P we can see the rot for Rotto one we've learnt

04:32.790 --> 04:41.270
from three neighbors 8 8 4 1 8 8 7 1 and 12 took one but one one.

04:41.760 --> 04:49.150
So these two are actually the same Rodda but BGP sees that as two separate neighbor relationships.

04:49.150 --> 04:50.490
He has an interesting one.

04:50.490 --> 04:59.280
Notice this network 8 8 4.0 has been advertised by four routers the local Radhe of four is advertising

04:59.280 --> 05:10.760
the network here Rodda two is advertising it on this link as well as via the serial link and router

05:10.790 --> 05:15.480
three is advertising that network to root for.

05:15.650 --> 05:22.370
In other words this network was advertised by Rodda to to write a 1 then to rodded three and advertised

05:22.370 --> 05:30.530
back to write a full we can see that by looking at the biggest path notice we see three autonomous systems

05:30.530 --> 05:32.240
to get to that route.

05:32.380 --> 05:40.940
But to the best route is via the local router to that destination because the local router is directly

05:40.940 --> 05:43.840
connected to that network.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.670
So it has the best route.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.230
But let's see if we can ping the loopback one.

05:48.330 --> 06:00.800
Yes we can trace to the Lubeck of right of one it's going via this link 8 8 4 1 then 8 8 2 8 to 1 BGP

06:00.810 --> 06:03.050
takes care of routing loops.

06:03.120 --> 06:08.790
So if we didn't have to worry about writing loops in the topology BGP doesn't allow Rantz advertised

06:09.120 --> 06:13.640
by the local Rodda to be advertised back in to the autonomy system.

06:13.680 --> 06:20.350
So there are no rotting loops in the apology and the network is working as expected.

06:20.370 --> 06:27.990
What I want you to see is we can have multiple BGP relationships on a road the road one has to do two

06:27.990 --> 06:31.320
separate autonomous systems Rato for

06:35.490 --> 06:40.900
has three neighbor relationships two or two the same router same autonomous system.

06:40.900 --> 06:45.730
Number one is to a separate autonomous system number BGP.

06:45.750 --> 06:53.510
However will use a complex criteria to determine the best route to a destination.

06:53.560 --> 06:57.530
So to get to one this has been chosen as the best route.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.610
Notice the greater than sign.

07:00.250 --> 07:04.300
But we do have alternate routes to the destination.

07:04.330 --> 07:17.020
So if I ping could ripple one pings succeed trace to one trace goes via 8 8 a toad forward 1.

07:17.100 --> 07:26.760
So in other words via this link what I'll do now is go to write it to and all shut gigabit 001 down

07:27.930 --> 07:30.850
so that a link has gone down.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.620
Notice the BGP relationship has gone down.

07:34.110 --> 07:41.710
So now when we trace to one that wondered wondered one it goes via eight eight to 7.1.

07:41.730 --> 07:46.280
Using this link and if we shut to that serial link down

07:51.600 --> 07:57.890
share to face brief shows us the serial interface Shibe interface serial zeros like one.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.020
Shut it down.

08:03.860 --> 08:05.620
So this should be that actually

08:09.040 --> 08:09.970
interfaces don't

08:12.900 --> 08:17.030
but a can still trace to the loopback of wrote a one

08:19.730 --> 08:23.570
because the traffic is going via toll 1 1 1.

08:23.570 --> 08:34.580
In other words via a router 3 so I'm ready to if I know shunter those interfaces again and interface

08:34.580 --> 08:46.720
gigabit to 0 0 1 shunt IP BGP summary configuration is done show IP BGP.

08:47.100 --> 08:50.510
And I was looking for neighbors but noticed the one neighbor relationship has come up.

08:50.970 --> 08:53.840
So a study to study one is established.

08:53.890 --> 08:59.570
That's to one 8.8 dot 1:56 is active.

08:59.580 --> 09:05.160
We need to wait for this neighbor relationship to come up but notice it's now just come up.

09:05.250 --> 09:06.120
So that's good.

09:06.120 --> 09:12.930
So let's look at that again show IP BGP neighbor noticed the neighbor relationship is now established

09:14.240 --> 09:17.600
and scrolling down 8 8 7 to 2.

09:17.650 --> 09:26.340
He's also established so we have the relationship established from Rotto 3 to a full so on.

09:26.350 --> 09:27.300
Rato for

09:30.860 --> 09:35.480
two neighbor relationships have come up.

09:35.610 --> 09:43.130
We can still Pinga loop back of thought of one at the moment the prompt is still going via this link

09:43.740 --> 09:53.100
because that's the oldest wrote in the writing table again BGP has a complex routing determination algorithm

09:53.580 --> 09:55.990
which you don't need to know for CCMA.

09:56.580 --> 10:05.350
But notice the best route is 12. one but one that one so hence the traffic is going via router three

10:05.980 --> 10:07.690
instead of router 2.

10:07.960 --> 10:14.440
But what this does prove is it proves that we have redundancy in our BGP topology.

10:14.530 --> 10:21.880
If a link goes down or if there's a problem in the ISP traffic it can reroute via an alternate path.

10:22.610 --> 10:25.060
BGP is very powerful.

10:25.250 --> 10:34.480
So let's break this link and what we should see is rockfall automatically sends traffic via router to.

10:34.850 --> 10:38.720
So this link is not directly connected to rockfall

10:43.090 --> 10:45.030
interface it is zero slash one.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.240
Shut it down.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.320
On wrote a full ping 1 1 1 pings succeed.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.370
Trace one 1 one 1.

10:57.610 --> 11:02.210
Notice the traffic is now going via 8 8 forward 1.

11:02.560 --> 11:14.400
So it has transitioned to using this link almost Shaktar that link and to save the configuration of

11:14.430 --> 11:18.520
all my routers again BGP is very powerful.

11:20.710 --> 11:24.580
You need to know the basics of BGP for your exam.
