WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:09.230
So let's start with a one on one show IP interface brief.

00:09.550 --> 00:17.400
We can see the IP address configured on gigabit is zero slashes zero slash zero as well as gigabit to

00:17.400 --> 00:27.120
zero slashes zero slash 1 and the link back the IP addresses look correct per the diagram and the interfaces

00:27.120 --> 00:27.940
are up up.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.970
So that's good.

00:30.480 --> 00:40.410
We could test to connectivity to prove that things are working second rate of one paying rodder to yes

00:40.410 --> 00:45.980
it can Kennet paying Rondeau three yes it can.

00:45.990 --> 00:57.090
So we have connectivity from router 1 to routed to and router 3 BGP relies on TZP which relies on Layer

00:57.090 --> 00:57.840
2.

00:58.050 --> 01:06.490
In this case Ethernet Connections we've got to make sure that layer 1 2 3 and 4 are working properly

01:07.580 --> 01:10.930
they are no access lists configured in this network.

01:10.970 --> 01:12.720
So we won't worry about that.

01:12.890 --> 01:19.610
But we've proven that IP connectivity works so let's configure BGP autonomous system number sixty five

01:19.630 --> 01:30.230
thousand one we can to specify neighbor and the first neighbor which is rodded two in autonomy system

01:30.230 --> 01:33.130
number sixty five thousand two.

01:34.640 --> 01:42.650
And then we need to configure our second neighbor which is ratus three in a tunnel system number sixty

01:42.650 --> 01:44.000
five thousand three

01:48.150 --> 01:51.810
now advertise the leap back into BGP.

01:52.020 --> 02:03.540
And while we here advertise the gigabit 000 interface and gigabit 0 0 1

02:07.170 --> 02:12.910
I made a mistake on that previous c'mon.

02:13.420 --> 02:20.870
Let me remove that the network mask has to be configured exactly.

02:21.080 --> 02:28.890
So let's confirm what I've done show run that that's the configuration BGP is configured in.

02:28.890 --> 02:40.830
Autonomous system 65000 one that looks good neighbor 8 8 8 2 2 autonomous system number 65000 to neighbor

02:41.070 --> 02:46.840
troll 0 0 2 ton system number sixty five thousand three.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.150
That looks good.

02:48.450 --> 02:50.340
That's the loop back.

02:50.340 --> 02:53.700
This is the thing to face.

02:53.910 --> 02:59.280
And this is the interface to confirm that things are configured right.

02:59.280 --> 03:07.380
We can use the IP BGP and that should tell us if our networks are advertised properly at the moment

03:07.410 --> 03:11.930
we see network 12 and network 1 but we don't see network 8.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.130
So let's confirm that it's done right.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.500
That's the IP address on the gigabit interface.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.850
And that does look right.

03:20.850 --> 03:26.560
So this may be a packet tracer issue show IP Rotch to confirm that.

03:26.670 --> 03:32.660
Notice this network is directly connected on gigabit 0 0 0.

03:32.820 --> 03:38.520
So that should be advertised into BGP.

03:38.560 --> 03:45.240
Again this may be a packet trace a problem no rats are currently showing.

03:45.240 --> 03:53.460
So what I'll do is all configure Rodda to and router free and hopefully packet tracer will sort itself

03:53.460 --> 03:54.130
out.

03:54.400 --> 03:59.930
So the only issue using simulators you may have funny behavior.

04:00.350 --> 04:11.460
So in order to show IP interface brief IP address he looks at IP addresses on these interfaces look

04:11.490 --> 04:15.310
correct and we've got to loop back interface.

04:15.360 --> 04:21.780
So what I'll do is just configure the link to write a one on both Rodek to and Roger 3 and see if we

04:21.780 --> 04:25.330
can get to that relationship coming up.

04:25.770 --> 04:38.940
Serrata BGP 65000 to neber 8 8 2 8 to 1 remote autonomy system 65000 1 BGP relationship has come up.

04:38.940 --> 04:44.900
So that's a good on a one we can see the neighbor relationship come up.

04:44.900 --> 04:49.640
Should I be BGP and now the rats are showing in the writing table.

04:49.710 --> 04:54.020
So I was just a bit impatient with packet tracer.

04:54.070 --> 05:00.170
Again this is a simulation so you can have problems.

05:00.980 --> 05:08.520
I'll advertise the loop back and I'll advertise 8 8 8 2 0.

05:10.320 --> 05:20.010
And while I'm here advertise these two networks so Network 8 8 4 0

05:23.150 --> 05:29.200
network 8 8 7 0.

05:29.420 --> 05:30.410
So there we go.

05:32.430 --> 05:37.220
Show IP BGP we can see a bunch of rats in the writing table.

05:37.260 --> 05:49.500
Let's have a look at raht of one show IP BGP Rotto displaying and we can ping the loop back of rockety.

05:49.520 --> 05:59.690
So what I'll do now is configure rodder three so on router 3 router BGP 65000 and three.

06:00.010 --> 06:10.290
That's our autonomous system number neighbor 12 0 0 1 remote autonomy system sixty five thousand and

06:10.290 --> 06:13.520
one neighbor relationship has come up.

06:13.520 --> 06:23.360
Network 12 0 0 0 mosque 24 mosque network advertise the loopback

06:25.790 --> 06:39.760
network and we need to advertise this network 12 1 1 0 so Network 12 1 1 0 a mosque and all uses Flash

06:39.830 --> 06:40.840
24 mosque

06:44.660 --> 06:53.310
so show PBG this network is showing the network is showing it's being advertised by the local Rodda.

06:53.350 --> 07:01.210
This network has shown advertised by the local Rodda so on Grado one 10 we paying the loop back of Rotto

07:01.210 --> 07:02.830
3.

07:04.180 --> 07:15.340
Yes we can show PBG we need the shows us that we have a neighbor relationship that's established 2 8

07:15.540 --> 07:25.210
8 8 to 2 and we have a neighbor relationship to 12 0 0 2 that's established so both neighbor relationships

07:25.210 --> 07:28.460
on the site are established so that it looks good.

07:28.480 --> 07:32.270
So now let's configure customer to

07:35.090 --> 07:40.460
and get it to talk to both use piece.
